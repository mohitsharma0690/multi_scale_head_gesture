The following document describes the coding style adopted for the hCRF
library. The first part is about the c++ coding style, the second part
is concentrated on unit testing.

1. C++ Coding style

The following conventions are adopted in the c++ code:

- The maximal line length is 80 characters. This help when printing
code

- The code is indented using tab. The default width of a tab is 4
spaces (useful when one must mix tab and spaces for multi-line code)

- The opening and closing braces of block are on a line on their own.

- One line block should be enclosed in braces.

2. Unit Testing

Unit testing is gaining a lot of traction in the development
world. It's most often cited advantages are: 
1. Facilitate changes
2. Documentation
3. Design

The gtest library (Google Test) is a useful library to conduct
unit-testing in C++. New functionality in the library should have 
unit tests written.
